1
00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:13.071
My name's Ed Snowden, I'm 29 years old.

2
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:19.460
I work for Booz Allen Hamilton as an
Infrastructure Analyst for NSA, in Hawaii.

3
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.920
>> What are some of the positions that
you've held previously within

4
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.420
the Intelligence Community?

5
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.239
>> I've been a System's Engineer, System's
Administrator, Senior Advisor,

6
00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.974
for the, Central Intelligence Agency,
Solutions Consultant and

7
00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:41.990
a, Telecommunications Information System's
Officer.

8
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.730
>> One of the things people are gonna be
most interested in,

9
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.650
in, in, in trying to understand what, who
you are, and what you're thinking is?

10
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.908
There came some point in time when you
crossed this line of thinking about being

11
00:00:54.908 --> 00:01:01.320
the [UNKNOWN] Whistleblower to making the
choice to actually become a Whistleblower.

12
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.200
Walk people all through that decision
making process.

13
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.830
>> When you're in positions of, of
Privileged Access, like

14
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.910
a System's Administrator for these sort of
Intelligence Community and Agencies.

15
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.570
You're exposed to a lot more information
on

16
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.420
a broader scale than the average employee.

17
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.940
And because of that, you see things that
may be disturbing.

18
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.450
But over the course of a normal person's
career, you'd only see one or

19
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.340
two of these instances.

20
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.520
When you see everything, you see them on a
more frequent basis, and

21
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.440
you recognize that some of these things
are actually abuses.

22
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.000
And when you talk to people about them in
a place like this where this is the,

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.440
the normal state of business.

24
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.820
People tend not to take them very
seriously and you know, move on from them,

25
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.780
but over time that awareness of wrong
doing sort of builds up, and

26
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.340
you feel compelled to talk about it, and
the more you talk about it,

27
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.680
the more you're ignored, the more you're
told it's not a problem.

28
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.820
Until eventually you realize that these
things need to be determined by

29
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.190
the public, not by somebody who is simply
hired by the government.

30
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.040
>> Talk a little bit about how the
American Surveillance State

31
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.900
actually functions that are, does it
target the actions of Americans?

32
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.630
>> NSA and the Intelligence Community in
general is focused on

33
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.490
getting Intelligence whenever it can by
whatever means possible.

34
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.769
That it believes, on the grounds of sort
of self-certification,

35
00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.730
that they serve the national interest.

36
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.430
originally, we saw that

37
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.440
focus very narrowly tailored as Foreign
Intelligence gathered overseas.

38
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.720
Now increasingly we see that it's
happening domestically.

39
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.030
And to do that, they the NSA specifically
targets the communications of everyone.

40
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.250
It ingests them by default.

41
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.710
It collects them in its system, and it
filters them and it analyzes them and

42
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.900
it measures them and it stores them.

43
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.260
For periods of time, simply because that's
the easiest, most efficient, and

44
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.080
most valuable way to achieve these ends.

45
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.150
So while they may be intending to target
someone

46
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.200
associated with a Foreign Government or
someone that they suspected terrorism.

47
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.840
They're collecting your communications to
do so.

48
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.690
Any Analysts at any time can target any
selector anywhere.

49
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.560
Where those communications will be picked
up depends on the range of

50
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.940
the Sensor Networks and the authorities
that, that Analyst is empowered with.

51
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.950
Not all Analysts have the ability to
target everything.

52
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.560
But I, sitting in my desk, certainly had
the authorities to, to wire tap anyone.

53
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.020
From you or your accountant,

54
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.700
to a Federal Judge to even the President
if I had a personal email.

55
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.685
>> One of the extraordinary parts about
this episode is that usually about

56
00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:50.560
Whistleblower, do what they do anonymously
and take steps to remain anonymous for

57
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.730
as long as they can, which they hope often
is forever.

58
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.120
You, on the other hand, have decided to do
the opposite,

59
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.250
which is to declare yourself openly as the
person behind these disclosures.

60
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.010
Why did you choose to do that?

61
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.670
>> I, I think that the public is owed an
explanation of the motivations behind

62
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.300
the people who make these disclosures that
are outside of the democratic model.

63
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.110
When you are subverting the power of
government, that's,

64
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.750
that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to
democracy.

65
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.500
And if you do that in secret consistently
you know,

66
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.060
as the government does when it wants to
benefit from a secret action that it took.

67
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.100
It'll kind of give it, it's officials a
mandate to go hey, you know,

68
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.040
tell the press about this thing and thing,
so the public is on our side.

69
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.860
But they rarely if ever do that when abuse
occurs.

70
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.030
That falls to individual citizens.

71
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.220
But, they're typically maligned.

72
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.260
You know, it, it becomes a thing of these
people are against the country.

73
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.960
They're against the government.

74
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.060
But, I'm not.

75
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.590
I'm, I'm no different from anybody else.

76
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.090
I don't have special skills.

77
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.710
I, I'm just another guy who sits there day
to day in the office,

78
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.760
watches what happening, what's happening,
and goes.

79
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.610
This is something that's not our place to
decide.

80
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.420
The public needs to decide whether these
programs and policies are right or wrong.

81
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.640
And I'm willing to go on the record to
defend the authenticity of them and

82
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.200
say, I didn't change these.

83
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.610
I didn't modify the story.

84
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.720
This is the truth.

85
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.220
This is what's happening.

86
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.330
You should decide whether we need to be
doing this.

87
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.310
>> Have you given thought to what it is
that the US

88
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.570
government's response to your conduct is,
in terms of what they might say about you,

89
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.240
how they might try to depict you, what
they might try to do to you?

90
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.930
yeah, I, I could be you know, rendered
from the CIA.

91
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.712
I, I could have people come after me or

92
00:05:38.712 --> 00:05:41.154
any of the their, their third-party
partners.

93
00:05:41.154 --> 00:05:44.068
You know, they would, they work closely
with a number of other nations.

94
00:05:44.068 --> 00:05:46.480
well, you know, they could pay off the
triads, or

95
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.170
you know, any, any of their agents are
assets are.

96
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.310
We;ve, we;'ve got a CIA station just up
the road in the,

97
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.300
the consulate here in Hong Kong.

98
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.410
And I'm sure they're gonna be very busy
for the next week.

99
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.400
And that's, that's a fear I'll live under
for

100
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.750
the rest of my life, however long that
happens to be.

101
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.970
You, you can't come forward against the
world's most powerful

102
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.210
Intelligence Agencies and be completely
free from risk because they're

103
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.010
such powerful adversaries that, that no
one can meaningfully oppose them.

104
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.230
If they want to get you, they'll get you
in time.

105
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.210
But at the same time,

106
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.940
you have to make a determination about
what it is that's important to you?

107
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:31.330
And if living living living unfreely but
comfortably is something

108
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.580
you're willing to accept, and I think may
of us are, it's, it's the human nature.

109
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.900
You can get up every day.

110
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.680
You can go to work.

111
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.100
You can collect your, your large paycheck
for relatively little work.

112
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.970
Against the public interest, and, and

113
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.310
go to sleep at night after watching your
shows.

114
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.470
But if you realize that that's the world
that you helped create, and

115
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.490
it's gonna get worse with the next
generation and the next generation who

116
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.870
extend the capabilities of this sort of
architecture of oppression.

117
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.226
You realize that you might be willing to
accept any risk, and

118
00:07:04.226 --> 00:07:05.936
it doesn't matter what the outcome is so

119
00:07:05.936 --> 00:07:09.670
long as the public gets to make their own
decisions about how that's applied.

120
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.320
>> Why should people care about
surveillance?

121
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.300
>> Because even if you're not doing
anything wrong,

122
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.000
you're being watched and recorded.

123
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.130
And the, the storage capability of these
systems increases every year.

124
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.640
Consistently by orders of magnitude, to
where it's getting to

125
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.690
the point you don't have to have done
anything wrong, you simply have to

126
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.970
eventually fall under suspicion from
somebody, even by a wrong call.

127
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.120
And then they can use the system to go
back in time and scrutinize every

128
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.480
decision you've ever made, every friend
you've ever discussed something with, and

129
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:49.350
attack you on that basis to sort of derive
suspicion from an innocent life and

130
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.491
paint anyone into context of a wrong doer.

131
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:55.264
>> We are currently sitting in a room in,

132
00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:59.870
in Hong Kong of which is where we are
because you traveled here.

133
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.504
Talk a little but about why it is that you
came here, and

134
00:08:03.504 --> 00:08:08.560
specifically they're gonna be people who
will speculate that what you

135
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.589
really intend to do is to defect to the
country that many see as

136
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:16.393
the number one rival of the United States
which is China.

137
00:08:16.393 --> 00:08:20.277
And that way you're really doing is
essentially seeking to

138
00:08:20.277 --> 00:08:25.990
aid an enemy of the United States,
with, which you intend to seek asylum.

139
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.530
Can you talk a little bit about that?

140
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.439
>> Sure.
So there,

141
00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:32.504
there's a couple of assertions in, in
those arguments that are,

142
00:08:32.504 --> 00:08:36.940
that are sort of embedded in the, the
questioning of the choice of Hong Kong.

143
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.900
The first is that China is an enemy of the
United States.

144
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.690
It, it's not.

145
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.420
I mean, there, there are conflicts between
the United States government and

146
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.420
the Chinese PRC government, but the, the
peoples inherently, you know,

147
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.290
we, we don't care.

148
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.020
We trade with each other freely, you know,

149
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.890
we're not at war, we're not in armed
conflict, and we're not trying to be.

150
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.040
We're, we're the largest trading partners
out there for each other.

151
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:07.310
additionally, Hong Kong has a strong
tradition of free speech.

152
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.680
People think oh, China, great firewall.

153
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.780
Mainland China does have significant
restrictions on free speech.

154
00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.050
But the Hong Kong, the people of Hong
Kong.

155
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.260
Have a long tradition of protesting in the
streets, of making their views known,

156
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.740
that Internet is not filtered here, no
more so

157
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.610
than any Western Government, and I believe
that the Hong Kong government is

158
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:36.009
actually independent, in relation to a lot
of other leading Western governments.

159
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.710
>> If your motive had been to harm the
United States and help its enemies is, or

160
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.180
if your motive had been personal material
gain, were there things that you could

161
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.990
have done with these documents to advance
those goals that you didn't end up doing?

162
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.630
>> Oh, absolutely.

163
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.100
I mean, an, anybody in the positions of
access with the take,

164
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.650
technical capabilities that I had.

165
00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:00.580
Could, you know, suck out secrets, pass
them on the open market to Russia.

166
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.650
You know, they always have an open door,
as we do.

167
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.090
I had access to, you know, the, the full
rosters of everyone working at the NSA,

168
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.680
the entire intelligence community.

169
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.950
And undercover assets all around the
world.

170
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.030
The locations of every station.

171
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.020
We have what their missions are, and so
forth.

172
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.998
If I had just wanted to harm the US, you,

173
00:10:21.998 --> 00:10:28.350
you know, that, you could shut down the,
the Surveillance System in an afternoon.

174
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.780
But that's not my intention, and I, I
think for anyone making that argument,

175
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.120
they need to think, if they were in my
position and you know,

176
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.980
you live a privileged life, you, you're
living in Hawaii in paradise and

177
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.400
making a ton of money.

178
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:47.350
What would it take to make you leave
everything behind?

179
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:53.890
The, the greatest fear that I have
regarding the outcome for

180
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.800
America of these as closures, is that
nothing will change.

181
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.080
People will see in the media all of these
as closures.

182
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.890
They'll know the lengths that the,

183
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:09.160
the government is going to grant
themselves powers, unilaterally,

184
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:16.720
to create greater control over American
Society and Global Society.

185
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:23.150
But they, they won't be willing to take
the risks necessary to stand up and

186
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.950
fight to change things,

187
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:32.410
to force their representatives to actually
take a stand in their interests.

188
00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:37.530
And the months ahead, the, the years
ahead, it's only gonna get worse

189
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.880
until eventually there will be a time
where policies will change.

190
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.650
Because the only thing that restricts the
activities of

191
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.390
the surveillance state are policy.

192
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.140
Even in our agreements with, with other
Sovereign Governments,

193
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.560
we consider that to be a stipulation of
policy rather than a stipulation of law.

194
00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.460
And because of that, a new leader will be
elected, they'll flip the switch say that

195
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.420
because of the crisis, because of the
dangers that we face in the world,

196
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.840
you know, some, some new and

197
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.230
unpredicted threat we need more authority,
we need more power.

198
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:19.104
And there will be nothing the people can
do at that point to oppose it.

199
00:12:19.104 --> 00:12:20.824
And it'll be Turnkey Tyranny.
