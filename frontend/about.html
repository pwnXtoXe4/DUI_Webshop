                    The SecTech Logo shows a shield with a keyhole. The shield represents security, while the keyhole
                    stands for accessibility. SecTech connects these two concepts by making security accessible to
                    everyone.

                        The wordmark <i>SecTech</i> is a deliberately shortened and abstracted coined term derived from
                        the words <strong>Security</strong> and <strong>Technology</strong>.
                        In contrast to the logo, it does not show our mission, but our identity. We provide Technologies
                        for Security, helping our customers to thrive in a secure environment.

                        We use a combination of purple colors as a recurring brand element.
                        The colors represent innovation, creativity, and a forward-looking mindset.
                        We also use the color purple to distinguish our brand from competitors.
                        The security sector predominantly uses black, grey, blue, or red tones.
                        With purple, we create a new experience from the established standard.
